Projects that I enjoy working on:

[pivot.js](https://github.com/rjackson/pivot.js) -- A data analysis tool inspired by MS Excel Pivot Tables.
[pingly](https://github.com/rjackson/pingly) -- A simple tool to help notify me of network outages.

Maybe you would like me to tell you about the ever exciting <%= link_to "pivot.js", "https://github.com/rjackson/pivot.js" %> which is a data analysis tool inspired by MS Excel Pivot Tables. Or can I interest you in stories of <%= link_to "pingly"? The simple tool I put together to help notify me of network outages.  Well perhaps hippo?  This one is a really boring but impressive tool for HIPAA 5010 transaction set implementation.  I could also go on about Singleton_process (a tool that ensures solitary process operation), work_days (another tool used to calculate work days in calendar month) or image_viewer_rails (a Rails engine used to display images for data entry.)
